R10.5 Events: What is an event object? An event source? An event listener?

Event Object\ An event is an object when it is generated by Java's GUI component.

Event Source\ The user-interface component of an event object such as a button. Event sources report when an event has
occurred to the event listener.

Event Listener\ Event listeners belong to the class created by the application. Their methods provide the actions on what to
do while an event occurs

R10.6 actionPerformed: Who calls the actionPerformed method of an event listener? When does the call to the actionPerformed method occur?

The event source such as a button calls the actionPerformed method of the event listener. The call occurs when the user interacts with
the event source with a click, press, etc... action.

R10.11 Inner class and event-listeners: Why are we using inner classes for eventlisteners? If Java did not have inner classes, could we still implement event listeners? How?

There are two advantages to using inner classes for eventListener: 1) convenience, the code for an eventListener is typically
pretty short so it's nice having it near where its going to be called rather than in a separate file. 2) access to instance variables,
the eventListener can access the instant variable of the event source in its actionPerformed method. If Java didn't have inner classes,
you the eventListener would need to be constructed with a reference to the event source.

R10.14 Object hierarchies: Name a method that is declared in JTextArea, a method that JText Area inherits from JTextComponent, and a method that JTextArea inherits from JComponent?

declared in JTextArea\ append() method
inherit from JTextComponent\ setText() method
inherit from JComponent\ setUI() method

R10.22 Graphic methods: How would you modify the drawItalianFlag method in HowTo10.1 to draw any flag with a white vertical stripe in the middle and two arbitrary colors to the left and right?

add parameters for left and right colors and modify setColor call to read g.setColor(leftColor) and g.setColor(rightColor)

R11.2 Layout managers: What is the advantage of a layout manager over telling the container “place this component at position (x, y)”?
It places components in containers so that they can behave more dynamically. E.g. if user shifts screen the component will remain
in container rather than being static at predefined points x,y.


R11.11 ButtonGroup: Why do you need a button group for radio buttons but not for checkboxes?
Only one radio button can be selected so selecting one will replace another in the button group class. Use radio buttons when options are
mutually exclusive. When they are not use checkboxes which do not require just one to be selected.


R11.19 Types of Events: What is the difference between an ActionEvent and a MouseEvent?
ActionEvent is attached to an object registered with a component and only occurs when that object is interacted with. A mouse event tracks
interesting movements of the mouse. Mouse events also carry the

R11.20 Events: What information does an action event object carry? What additional information does a mouse event object carry? Hint: Check the API documentation.

The action event carries the event object to every ActionListener associated with the specific component. Mouse Events also carry x and y coordinates
of mouse event, type of mouse event (e.g. click, press, released, etc.), time of click, click count, popup trigger boolean and button number.

R11.21 ActionListener versus MouseListener: Why does the ActionListener interface have only one method, where as the MouseListener has five methods?
ActionListeners are only associated with a component-defined action whereas MouseEvents can interact with a component in multiple ways if implemented. For instance,
if the MouseEvent can change the color of a button when pressed and change it back with the mouse press is released. It really just allows for more
customization as the effects are similar for many types of components.
