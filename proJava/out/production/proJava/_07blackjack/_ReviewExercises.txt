R13.1 Terms

a. Recursion: A recurisve computation solves a problem by using the solution to the same problem with simpler imputes
b. Iteration: Repeating a process (looping) to solve a solution.
c. Infinite recursion: A method that calls itself over and over with no end solution.
d. Recursive helper method: a method that modifies the original problem so that a recursive solution can be implemented

R13.2 Smallest value: Recursion

In body of method call min function on an element of array and on the min of the rest of the array.

R13.3 Sort array of numbers

First check length of array and return if length is 0.
Then find the min of the array recursively and pop it from array.
Then return min element and recursive call on remainder of array.

R13.6 Exponents recursively

F(n) = x * F(n-1)

R13.8 Factorial recursively

F(n) = n * F(n-1)
